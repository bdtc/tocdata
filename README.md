# tocdata
LaTeX tocdata package â€” Optionally prints author, artist, or other data on a line of the TOC/LOF.

The tocdata package adds information such as an author or artist to an entry in the table of contents or list of figures or new float type. This new information is placed on a single line along with the caption and page number, as is commonly done in collections of literature, poetry, or art work.

Example:

~~~
1 A Challenge  . . . . . . . Hayashi Genbi  4
2 Astronometer . . . . . . . John Herschel  6
3 Diagram of a Sunbeam . . . Isaac Newton  10
~~~

The code is at CTAN: https://ctan.org/pkg/tocdata
